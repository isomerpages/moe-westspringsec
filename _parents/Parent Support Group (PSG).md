### **WELCOME TO WSSS PSG! [Click here to join us!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rMwviyMa7disZRz_yHCfSYKPnVLT49Jd2poAKJfnDAo/edit?chromeless=1)**

We are a vibrant community of parents who share the school’s vision of shaping our students into ladies and gentlemen of character and learning.  Since 2006, we have been promoting strong parental involvement in our students’ secondary school educational journey and partnering our school leaders in making the school a more caring and conducive environment for our students’ well-being and holistic learning.  PSG serves as an important channel of communication between parents and the school – we listen to parents’ feedback on school operations, practices and programmes and relay such feedback to the school. We also foster close ties among our students, the school and our wider community through community outreach events.

### **SCHOOL EVENTS** 


In 2019, PSG played an active role in supporting the school in various key events in the school calendar – Open House, Secondary One Orientation Week, Cross-country Run at Japanese Garden, Sports Day and Teachers’ Day.

  **PSG ACTIVITIES** 

We organised many fun-filled and wholesome activities as well as regular badminton sessions for parent-child bonding.  Many of these activities also provided great opportunities for our students to display school values-in-action. The following are some of the highlight events of the year.

##### **HARMONY @ SENJA CNY CELEBRATIONS**

WSSS parents and students of different races and from all walks of life visited and distributed Chinese New Year goodies to residents of Senja Grand, Senja Gateway and Senja Park View.  Residents were entertained with lively traditional songs by our very own WSSS Guzheng Ensemble as well as an exuberant Lion Dance performance.

WSSS fathers and students teamed up to strategise, outwit, “shoot and eliminate” other teams in this fun laser tag challenge.

##### **TERRARIUM WORKSHOP FOR TEACHERS’ DAY** 

WSSS parents and students enjoyed making mini-terrariums in this afternoon workshop.  These meaningful hand-made gifts were then presented to our esteemed Principal, school leaders and teachers on Teachers’ Day.

##### **SEMBAWANG BEACH CLEAN-UP**

This was a great opportunity for our parents and students to do their part for the environment, combing the beach for trash while enjoying the fresh outdoor air.  The participants saw first-hand the amount of plastic bottles and assorted trash that were discarded in the sea or onto the beach.

##### **SAFRA YISHUN ADVENTURE**

Parents and students showed grit, resilience and conquered their fear of heights in scaling up and abseiling down a 25-metre high Rock Wall. They also took part in the Canopy Sky Walker obstacle challenge where participants tackled a cargo net trail, broken bridge, island walk and flying fox challenge!

##### **PARENTING TALKS** 

PSG partnered the school and organised many informative parenting talks throughout the year. Topics that were covered include transitioning to Secondary One, overcoming online gaming addiction, improving parent-child communication by applying the ‘5 Languages of Love (™) and developing our students’ success quotients (i.e. IQ, EQ and AQ).
