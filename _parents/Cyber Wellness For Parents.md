Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. Cyber Wellness also involves being a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.


**‘Parents play a key role in shaping students’ behaviour in cyberspace. Parents are critical in anchoring strong values in their children to better manage their child’s internet exposure. Through the joint effort of parents and schools, we can ensure that our students adopt the right values and attitude when using technology.’**
