Dear parents,

**Arrangements for the Release of 2020 GCE O-Level Results on 11 Jan 2021**

MOE and SEAB have recently announced arrangements for the release of results for the 2020 national examinations to safeguard the well-being of students and staff.  [Link to press release on 27 Oct 20](https://go.gov.sg/resultsrelease2020)

**Safe Management Measures –**

The key arrangements are:

(a) **Students are expected to comply with Safe Management Measures in schools.**

(b) **Collection of results will be done in smaller groups in separate venues.**

Please note that **only students will be allowed** to enter the school to collect their results.

**Students who are unwell, on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice or Leave of Absence on the results release day should not return to school to collect their results**, and should view their results online instead. In this case, students who are unable to collect their results in school may appoint someone to collect the physical copy of the results, and the Joint Admissions Exercise Form, Polytechnic Foundation Programme form or Joint Intake Exercise form on their behalf within 3 working days (inclusive of the day of results release). If they are unable to do so, they can contact the school for assistance.

**Online access to results –**

In addition, all students will be able to view their results for the 2020 national examinations online, via SEAB’s results release system on the day of the respective national examination’s results release.

Students who are eligible for SingPass should login to the results release system via their SingPass. Students not eligible for SingPass will receive a system-generated password from SEAB closer to the results release day. More information on how to access the system will be made available on SEAB’s website in November 2020.

MOE and SEAB will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide updates if there are further changes to the arrangements for the release of results for this year’s national examinations. Thank you and stay safe!

Mr Adolphus Tan

Principal
