<p>Dear Sec 1 and Sec 2 Parents 2026</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Sentinel Programme is a talent development programme to develop our
nation’s cybersecurity talent pool by equipping youths with cybersecurity
and digital skills. Organised by the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS),
in collaboration with the Defence Technology Community, the programme is
fully sponsored by MINDEF/SAF.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The programme has been open for registration to Sec 1 and Pre-U 1 students
who are Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents. Students who are
successfully enrolled will learn basic programming, cryptography and network
forensics through hands-on workshops, competitions, and engagement sessions
with defence cyber professionals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To cater to students who develop an interest in the digital/cybersecurity
domain in the early secondary school years, the programme has introduced
an additional intake for students to join the programme at Secondary 3.
The next Secondary 3 intake (for 2027) is open for applications to 2026
Secondary 2 students.</p>
<p></p>
