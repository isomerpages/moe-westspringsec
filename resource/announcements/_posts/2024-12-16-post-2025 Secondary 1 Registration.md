<p>Your attendance for the session will be very much appreciated. The Principal,
together with Key Personnel, will provide important information, such as
the student development and academic programmes, student management system,

<p><strong>(G) Traffic Flow</strong>
</p>
<p>It is mandatory for students to observe road safety. They include the
use of footways, observation of traffic flow and abiding traffic rules
at road crossings. Pay attention to the road junctions and surroundings.
For safety, parents who drive their child to school should drop their child
at the School Designated drop off point. Parking and waiting are <strong><u>prohibited</u></strong> in
areas marked for handicapped access,</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="No waiting zone" src="/images/Foyer_.png">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The school maintains a two-way traffic flow system at all times, with
entry and exit exclusively through the main gate. Due to this being the
only primary access road to the school compound, it is essential to prioritize
safety at all times. Please see the maps below for more information.</p>
