As school re-opens on 29 Jan 2020, MOE will be enhancing precautionary measures, including daily temperature taking, to ensure that our schools remain a safe and healthy learning environment.

**Please ensure your child brings an Oral Digital Thermometer to school from 29 Jan onwards.** 

While teachers actively look out for students’ well-being, please ensure your child practises good personal hygiene and social responsibility. You should take your child to the doctor if he/she is unwell and we would appreciate it that you keep your child at home until he/she recovers.

If your child has returned from mainland China on 15 Jan or later, he/she will be placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) for a period of **14 days**, starting from the first day after return. For example, if your child returns to Singapore on **28 Jan (Tue)**, the LOA would last from **29 Jan to 11 Feb**, with the date of return to school being **12 Feb (Wed)**.

Students on LOA will be supported by home-based learning assigned by the school.  If you have any queries on LOA, you can call the school office at 68920369.
