Wafa graduated from West Spring Secondary in 2018 after completing the GCE O-Level examinations. She was from 5A/2018 and was one of the top students of her 5N cohort, scoring an impressive 14 points for the L1B4.  
According to Wafa, her time in West Spring Sec has taught her to be more caring and aware of her surroundings. Her VIA experience at the Hospice Centre in 2018 was eye-opening and made her realise how much she taken the things around her for granted.  
Her most memorable experiences were with the School Band. She formed lasting friendships with her band mates through the time they spent together.  
Her advice to her juniors: never let the negativity of others bring you down. You are leading your own life so make the best of it!

Shanna Tan graduated from West Spring Secondary in 2018 after completing her GCE O-Level Examinations. Shanna did well and scored 10 points for her L1B5. She was from 4B/2018 and was a Vice-President of the Student Council.  
Being a student leader in West Spring Sec has given her many opportunities to develop herself in other non-academic areas. She treasured the times she had with her fellow student councillors when they had to meet and plan for the various school events and activities, forming strong friendships at the same time.

Her teachers would also always provide the necessary push and advice to her when they felt she was falling behind. The invaluable support she has received from both teachers and friends was important for her to achieve her goals and set her on her way to success.  
She wishes her juniors all the best in their endeavours and to remember that when things get tough, the people around you would also be facing their own tough situations, so supporting each other is important.

Teo Kai Lun was admitted into Secondary 1 Normal Academic class in 2010. Unfazed by his humble PSLE score, Kai Lun begun working hard in his pursuit of academic excellence. A self-directed learner, Kai Lun was motivated to excel which led him to be promoted to the Express Stream in Secondary 3.

Kai Lun held the position of vice-captain of the school’s volleyball team. In addition, he was a very active member of the National Police Cadet Corps. His high sense of responsibility as class chairman in 2011 and 2013 and his commitment to building class spirit has earned him much respect from his classmates.

With the same grit and determination, Kai Lun has again done very well. I am very proud to witness him receiving the following accolades: Diploma In Nautical Studies (Course Medalist), Pacific International Lines Gold Medal, Singapore Nautical Institute Prize and Diploma With Merit. Congratulations Kai Lun!
