Loh Hong Rong, Class of 2011, was featured in the Straits Times in May 2015 as one of the first from the Singapore Polytechnic Biotechnology course to get into the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine with a near-perfect GPA of 3.98. He was quoted, “I hope that  by studying medicine, I can impact others some day.”

He was an active member of the NPCC unit and he returned to serve in NPCC as a cadet inspector from 2012 to 2015.

He has been an inspiration to other cadets. Even though he had a busy schedule, he made it a point to come back every week on Fridays to help train the NPCC cadets and impart the skills which he has acquired.

Prior to his enlistment in National Service, he contributed to the organisation of the SG 50 National Day Parade held in school. His dedication and commitment to the NPCC unit has been an inspiration, motivating more of his juniors to come back and serve at their unit.

Hui Shan enrolled in the Normal Technical stream in 2005 with a PSLE T-score of  138.  She was an active member of the NPCC and the cross-country team. She enrolled in a NITEC course in Medical Manufacturing Technology at ITE Central.

She worked very hard to achieve an outstanding GPA and subsequently completed a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Upon completion of her diploma, she enrolled into SIM-RMIT where she graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business with Logistics and Supply Chain.

Hui Shan’s success story is a timely reminder to all students that dreams will come true with self-belief, hard work and support from family, teachers and friends.
