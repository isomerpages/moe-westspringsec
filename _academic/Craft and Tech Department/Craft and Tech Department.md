| Key Programmes 	| The D&T Department aims to develop our students to be independent student designers through learning design thinking processes. Students are guided through various steps of a project, including needs identification, research, ideation, development and artefact realisation. In the process, they learn about the technology components of structures, electronics and mechanisms. Our programmes are mainly made up of carefully planned design-and-make projects. These projects are designed with deliberate activities and meaningful scaffolds to support our students. Students will undertake the projects by learning and applying relevant content that are sequenced for them as they work along in their projects. 	|
