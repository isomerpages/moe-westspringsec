| Key Programmes 	| The adopted pedagogies for both Food and Consumer Education (FCE) as well as the study of Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) were Activity Based Learning and Inquiry Based Learning, which hopes to engage students more meaningfully and provides them a rich learning experience. 
||Lower Secondary FCE students completed projects where they had to apply the concepts of nutrition and make informed choices as consumers. Students also modified a base recipe and created their very own savoury muffins suitable for children. In addition, Secondary 2 FCE students were introduced to Food Science Investigation where students carried out food experiments and evaluated the outcomes observed.  Students presented their findings through digital media. 
||Upper Secondary NFS students were presented with authentic learning experiences where they can relate and apply real life experiences through given scenarios. This helps develop students’ ability to understand the concept of nutrients and meal planning for the various age groups. Students also deepened their studies of Food Science to be better equipped with knowledge and skills to interpret results pertaining to sensory outcomes of food products they develop.
