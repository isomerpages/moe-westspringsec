| Key Programmes 	| The Nutrition and Food Science Unit aims to develop our students’ understanding of concepts of consumer education, nutrition and meal planning. The study of Food and Consumer Education and Nutrition and Food Science introduces the principles of Food Science. With the use of ICT in Coursework and Applied Modules, our students are encouraged to be independent and self-directed learners. 	|
