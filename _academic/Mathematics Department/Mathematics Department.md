| Key Programmes 	| Use of Questioning Techniques 	|
|  	| Questioning has a crucial role in the process of learning as it stimulates and maintains interest and encourages our students to think and focus on the content. Through planned questioning, we desire to steer our students’ thinking along a particular route in order to stimulate learning, to aid recall, and to challenge. 	|
|  	| In Semester 1, the Math department conducted an Algebra workshop for selected Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic) OOS students to help build a strong foundation in Algebra which is critical to the learning and performance of the students as they progress to upper secondary. Similarly, the department also conducted an in-house Geogebra workshop for all our Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic) OOS students to introduce the software to the students and to equip them with the basic skills for further exploration and for self-directed learning in the area of graphs. This is in line with the introduction of PLD initiative in school. 	|
