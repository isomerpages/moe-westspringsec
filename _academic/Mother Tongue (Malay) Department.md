| Key Programmes 	| **Language & Cultural Immersion Programme** 	|
|  	| Organised for Secondary 1 Malay language students, this programme provided a platform for the students to get to know their classmates in the same cohort whilst engaging in fun ‘kampung’ activities. Through activities such as ‘kampung’ games, an introduction to Malay traditional food and exposure to the arts such as batik painting, the programme aimed to enliven the Malay spirit in the hearts of West Spring ladies and gentlemen. 	|
|  	| **Hari Raya Celebration** 	|
|  	| The 2021 Hari Raya Celebration featured a virtual concert and students were engaged in an online experience to learn about how Hari Raya was celebrated in the past. The concert also showcased famous Hari Raya songs and dance with celebratory wishes from our very own West Spring students and staff. 	|
|  	| **Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Programme** 	|
|  	| The theme for the 2021 Mother Tongue Language Fortnight Programme for the Malay Language Unit was Traditional Malay costumes. Crafts and items made by students such as ‘batik’ bookmark, ‘tanjak’ and ‘samping’ became part of a school-wide exhibition curated by the Secondary 4 and 5 students. The exhibition also provided an opportunity for the students to experience a virtual museum tour. 	|
