<h1>Advocating for Sustainability (ActS)</h1>
<h5>Objective</h5>
<p>We hope WSSS students will be confident advocates of sustainability issues
through the effective use of media and collaboration with the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sec 1 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Environmental Advocacy focusing on sustainability
within the school community</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable School Challenge</strong> – “How might we reduce food
waste in West Spring Secondary School?” This was the Design Challenge that
Secondary 1 students undertook for the Applied Learning Programme this
year. Using the Design Thinking framework, the students developed innovative
solutions to encourage students, teachers, and canteen vendors to minimise
food waste. They documented their Design Thinking journey through infographics
and presentations. Additionally, students participated in an eco-learning
journey to Edible Garden City and Tzu Chi Humanistic Centre to gain insights
into sustainability practices in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Area of focus</strong> - Reducing food waste</p>
<p><strong>Key Skills</strong> - Critical, inventive, adaptive thinking skills,
collaboration, communication, media literacy

<p><strong>Sec 2 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Applied Learning for Geography cum ICT Project Work Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students learn the importance of identifying sources and to be literate
in media information presented to them. There is a study to check reliability
of sources to assist them further. All these are needed as they develop
key media literacy products through interviews, research and content analysis.
This is to allow our students to apply skills learnt to convey a particular
message based on a given theme. This provides opportunities for students
to work in groups to complete a media-related performance task and most
of the collaboration done are done via Google. However, during this Covid-19
period, more collaboration had to be done virtually. This programme is
done mainly by Humanities teachers. There is a 10-week workshop where vendors
are engaged to teach our students media literacy skills.</p>
