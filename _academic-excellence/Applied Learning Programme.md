##### **ALP Objective: for students to be critical media consumers and competent media producers** #####

**Secondary 1 – English-Language Public Speaking and Presentation**

Through this programme, we hope that our students will be able to stand up and speak with confidence and to be prepared for tertiary education and the work force. This program is held throughout the year and is facilitated by the English Language teachers. Students are tasked to prepare and plan short speeches on various topics. Teachers will then guide them with ways to engage and inspire the audience and to further develop their public speaking skills.

**Secondary 2 – Applied Learning for Geography cum ICT Project Work Lessons**

Our students learn the importance of identifying sources and to be literate in media information presented to them. There is a study to check reliability of sources to assist them further. All these are needed as they develop key media literacy products through interviews, research and content analysis. This is to allow our students to apply skills learnt to convey a particular message based on a given theme. This provides opportunities for students to work in groups to complete a media-related performance task and most of the collaboration done are done via Google. However, during this Covid-19 period, more collaboration had to be done virtually. This program is done mainly by Humanities teachers. There is a 10-week workshop where vendors are engaged to teach our students media literacy skills.

**Student Journalism**

ALP and Publications are embarking on a new project known as Students Journalism. Our students volunteered to be involved in this project where they were guided to write on certain current topics that they felt passionate about and wished to present to their peers. Most of the recruitment and students’ training were done mainly by the ALP teachers. In 2022, we launched the student journalism in the school to encourage more students to join in and speak up on current issues.
