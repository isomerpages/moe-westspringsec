**Applied Learning Programme infusion in Secondary 1 EL** 

Secondary 1 students went through a 30-week programme in ALP (Media Literacy) where they advocated for a cause they believed in. Students learnt research, advocacy, digital media creation and presentation skills.

**ELL Week 2023**

Our annual ELL Week continued with a variety of activities to engage students to appreciate Language and Literature. We invited Ms. Geraldine Song to be a guest on the day of the competitions as part of the Meet the Playwright event to introduce students to local writers. 

**Read@WS**

Students subscribed to Straits Times IN In to keep abreast of current affairs and news that appeal to their age group.

**National Schools Literature Festival (bi-annual)** 

We participated in this year’s event with each category being represented by students from the different levels. (Sec 4 Debate team consisted of : Wee Keyi, Angela Lim, Tan Yi Ling)
