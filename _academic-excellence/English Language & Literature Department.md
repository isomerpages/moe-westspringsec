<h4><strong>Cultural Enrichment Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The Secondary 4 Literature students and selected Secondary 2 students
had the unique opportunity to watch a traditional Chinese opera play, Titoudao,
as part of their learning journey. This experience offered them a glimpse
into a rich cultural tradition, with its vibrant costumes, expressive makeup,
and melodic tunes captivating their attention. The performance allowed
the students to draw connections between the literary elements they studied
and the storytelling techniques in the opera. This enriching experience
broadened their understanding of diverse artistic expressions and deepened
their appreciation for the cultural heritage reflected in the art form.</p>
