<p><strong>Sports Carnival @ Chua Chu Kang Stadium</strong>
</p>
<p>The Carnival was a buffet spread of sporting activities that all students
were engaged in. The highlight was indeed the track events, where students
demonstrated their speed and agility to outpace their peers. Students who
were not involved in the track events were engaged in different activities
such as Pickleball, Tchoukball, Kin Ball and Touch Rugby. At each level,
our selected student leaders managed the sport with confidence and competence.
The finale was the teacher’s race, where the whole school rallied to support
and cheer their teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Get ActiveSG 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>The initiative is to engage the seniors to participate in healthy lifestyles
and activities. As part of the students’ learning, various ActiveSG coaches
came down to the school to guide and coach our students on the curated
games suitable for seniors. These include seated volleyball. Seniors from
Precious AAC @ Sunshine Gardens CCK were engaged in meaningful games in
our school. The finale was held at Sportshub. Our student leaders reflected
that the event was fruitful and meaningful as they engaged the seniors
in the various games and activities.</p>

<br><strong>National Day Observance Ceremony @ Sportshub</strong>
</p>
<p>This is the first time we observed National Day celebrations outside of
the school. This event is a collaboration with SportsSG, where the intent
was to celebrate National Day through sport. Students were treated to a
variety of sports activities organised by ActiveSG. The fun-filled day
was enjoyed by both teachers and students.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Learning Fiesta 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>This was organised by PESTA for teachers to share their best practices
at a national level. Our teachers shared our PLT project ‘Fun Fit with
Bingo' and DI in PE. The sharing received good feedback and raving reviews
from participants. As part of our belief in growing and developing teachers,
we will be sharing at other national platforms in 2025.</p>
