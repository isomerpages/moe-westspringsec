**Inter Class Games**

The Inter-Class Games were organised for all levels in Semester 1. The value of such competition is about forging friendships when a team is formed and challenged to work towards a common goal. In line with our Learning for Life Programme, students demonstrated sportsmanship, teamwork, and resilience. It was heartening to see that our students were gracious in victory and resilient in defeat. Sports Leaders  assisted the teachers as umpires, scorekeepers, timekeepers, and line judges.

**West Spring Cross-Country Run @ Sports Hub**

As part of our continuing efforts to promote healthy lifestyle, West Spring Cross Country @ Sports Hub was successfully concluded on 19 May. With an attendance rate of 95%, students and staff enjoyed the positive and meaningful experience. The inclusive event allowed both competitors and non-competitors to participate and complete the route in a safe manner. Even parents joined their children in the event to show their support for the event.

**Sec 1 Cohort Camp**

The Secondary 1 students had a fruitful and meaningful learning experience during the 3D2N camp. One of the key ingredients to the success was the active involvement of the Form Teachers during camp to strengthen the camaraderie and bonds between students and teachers. The trainers played a great role in easing the students into the rugged camp environment. With basic amenities, the students interacted well with the trainers and participated well during the activities. The support and encouragement for one another was clearly evident during the camp.

**Get Active! Singapore Workout 2023**

GASG is an initiative by ActiveSG to celebrate our nation’s birthday through sports. This year we have engaged the Sec 3 cohort to learn the new steps for Dance of the Nation as part of supporting the national initiative. Furthermore, we have involved our Student Councillors to participate in Seniors’ Sports Day @ GetActive! Singapore on 3 August 2023. We hosted Seniors from the Precious Active Ageing Centre (Sunshine Gardens @ Choa Chu Kang). The seniors taught our students how to play Kampung Games while our students taught them how to do Dance of the Nation. The meaningful activity is meant to promote intergenerational bonding  through modified sports.

**Experiential Learning Programme**

This year, students were involved in a variety of activities to further enhance their learning experiences. The Secondary One students were engaged in Laser Tag, Escape Room and Street Dance. The Street dance culminated into a showcase where the students had  to perform a routine they were taught by the instructors. Our Secondary Two students thoroughly enjoyed their sessions in bowling, dragon boating and team building activities. The Secondary Three students were involved in improvised rafting, Amazing Race@ SportsHub and a learning journey to Jewel @ Changi.
