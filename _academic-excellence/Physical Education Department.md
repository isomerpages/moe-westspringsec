| Key Programmes 	| **Secondary 3 Archery Programme**|
||At the start of the year, all the Sec 3 students went through a 2-hour programme on Archery with guidance from the experienced vendors. It was indeed a good platform for students to learn a new skill and share their learning experiences with their classmates and Form teacher. A fantastic start to the year indeed!|
||**Sec 3 Outward Bound School**|
||The OBS experience represents a key milestone for our Secondary 3s. Our students will experience a 2D 1N programme from 20-21 July. Although the programme is modified, it will certainly test our students' demonstrated grit and resilience.|
|Achievements and Highlights of 2022| With the easing of safe management measures, we resumed the Inter-Class Games for our Sec 2 and Sec 3 students. The value of such competition is about forging friendships when a team is formed and challenged to work towards a common goal. In line with our Learning for Life Programme, students demonstrated sportsmanship, teamwork, and resilience. What was more heartening is that our students were gracious in victory and resilient in defeat. We had the support of student volunteers as umpires, scorekeepers, timekeepers, and line judges. We would like to attribute the success of the games to the student volunteers.
