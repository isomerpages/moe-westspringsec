**Higher Chinese Programme**

To expose Higher Chinese students to a range of activities and to discover their interest, students attended different courses and also took part in a variety of competitions. This was also important in building their confidence.  The Secondary One and Two Higher Chinese students attended a four to six weeks  journalism programme and news production workshop respectively.

**Mother Tongue Language Fortnight (MTLF)**

To encourage students to speak their mother languages and understand their own culture, the Chinese and Malay Languages units prepared a two- week programme for all students.

**Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES**)

In conjunction with our school’s efforts to promote interest in and continual learning of Chinese Language and Culture, the Chinese Language Department brought the Secondary 1 students for a skit titled《包小龙捉贼记》performed by Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Arts & Cultural Troupe. It was an interactive skit where students participated during part of the skit.

**Conversational Chinese and Malay Program (CCM**)

The purpose of this programme was to help students acquire the languages that would enable them to communicate and understand our counterparts better. Malay students learnt basic conversational Chinese language while the Chinese student learn basic conversational Malay. With this programme, we hope that students will be able to bond better with their friends!
