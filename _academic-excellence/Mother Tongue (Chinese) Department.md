<p><strong>Higher Chinese Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As Higher Chinese students are more competent in their Mother Tongue,
they are exposed to a range of activities to discover their interests.
Students attended different courses and also took part in a variety of
competitions. This was also important in building their confidence. The
Secondary One and Two Higher Chinese students attended a four- to six-week
journalism programme and news production workshop, respectively. For others,
they took the lead in hosting competitions for students from other streams.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong>
</p>
<p>In conjunction with our school’s efforts to promote interest in and continual
learning of Chinese Language and Culture, the Chinese Language Department
brought the Secondary 1 students for a skit titled《孙悟空三打白骨精》. It was an
interactive skit where students participated during part of the skit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Conversational Chinese and Malay Program (CCM)</strong>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this programme was to help students acquire the languages
that would enable them to communicate and understand their counterparts
better. This year, this program is part of the Student Initiated Learning
Program. The Chinese students had learnt basic conversational Malay. With
this programme, we hope that students will be able to bond better with
their friends!&nbsp;</p>
