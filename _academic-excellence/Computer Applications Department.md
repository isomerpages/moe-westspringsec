<p>Our Computer Applications (CPA) curriculum provides students with fundamental
skills for the digital age. They have learnt how to use tools such as Microsoft
Office, Inkscape, and Openshot, as well as basic programming with Scratch.
Along with these technological skills, students have gained an understanding
of ethical, legal, and security concerns in technology.</p>
<p>Secondary 4 students travelled to the Kim Chuan train terminal on March
28, 2024, to examine train maintenance procedures, investigate technology
advancements and speak with depot employees. This tour enhanced their knowledge
of urban infrastructure and piqued their interest in sustainable mobility.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to recognise our students' accomplishments at the
National Animation and Game Making (AGM) Competition 2024. Jonas Poh from
3B received a silver award for his game promotion.</p>
