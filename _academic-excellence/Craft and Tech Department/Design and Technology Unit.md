The Design & Technology curriculum in West Spring aims to promote creative design through fun learning to develop students to be passionate designers.

In the early lower secondary, students learn the basics of sketching and drawing to apply to their design project. The lower secondary projects’ components include the design processes of generating and developing ideas, building mock-ups, creating sketch of developed idea and realising of prototypes.

Secondary One : Design and Make a Light cum Pencil Holder 

Secondary Two : Design and Make a Mechanism Toy
  
The Secondary Three students focussed on design journaling by applying design thinking processes. They also develop their drawing skills through using SketchUp software and prototype making skills in preparation for the GCE coursework in Secondary Four.
  

**Singapore Polytechnic Engineering Challenge**
Selected Secondary 2 students participated in this year’s Engineering Challenge and attended a Planter’s workshop organised by Singapore Polytechnic. The purpose of the workshop was to foster an understanding of sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation.
