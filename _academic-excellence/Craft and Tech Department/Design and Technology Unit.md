<p>The Design &amp; Technology curriculum in West Spring aims to promote
creative design through fun learning to develop students to be passionate
designers.</p>
<p>In the early lower secondary, students learn the basics of sketching and

components include the design processes of generating and developing ideas,
building mock-ups, creating sketch of developed idea and realising of prototypes.</p>
