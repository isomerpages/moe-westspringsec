**2023 Enrichment Workshop for Secondary 1**

In line with West Spring’s emphasis on holistic education and aesthetics appreciation, Secondary 1 students attended an enrichment workshop where they learnt how to play the cajon. During the workshop, students grasped basic techniques of the cajon, and also learnt and worked together as a class to perform drumming patterns with accompanying music. The cajon workshop also enhanced their coordination, memorisation and observation skills when they demonstrated their learning by performing a song together at the end.

**2023 Enrichment Workshop for Secondary 2**

The Secondary 2 students attended an enrichment workshop where they learnt how to dance. During the workshop, students built their confidence and teamwork as a class while they grasped basic techniques of hip hop, one of the most popular dance forms these days. In addition, learning the dance moves also allowed students to enhance their coordination, memorisation and observation skills, and demonstrate their learning by presenting a mini dance showcase together at the end.

**2023 Aesthetics Learning Journeys for all levels**

In line with West Spring’s emphasis on holistic education, our school embarked on the annual series of external learning journeys with the aim of introducing our students to various forms of aesthetics and performing arts. 

  Learning Journeys to date:

*   4 February 2023 - dance production at the Esplanade Theatre
    
*   25 April - indie concert at the Esplanade Concert Hall 
    
*   6 May 2023 - drama production at the Esplanade Theatre
    
*   26 August 2023 - indie concert at the Esplanade Annex Studio
    
Through these learning journeys, learning for students extended beyond the classroom and at the same time, they were able to broaden their horizons when they were exposed to various genres of performing arts beyond the familiar.

**2023 Aesthetics Week Concer**t

This annual concert aims to provide students with a platform to showcase their talents in the area of performing arts, be it playing a musical instrument, singing or dancing. Through the journey of auditions and rehearsals, this concert also provided students with the opportunities to build their self-confidence and resilience as a whole. In addition, the rest of the student population also benefited when they were exposed to the different forms of aesthetics and the performing arts during the showcase.
