**Key Programmes**

The Music Department focuses on student-centred activities as well as peer teaching to engage students and inculcate positive learning dispositions that help our students to become self-directed learners. Given their diverse musical tastes, students are given the opportunities to pursue a particular area of interest in the realm of music through the course of Music lessons.

Our Lower Secondary General Music Programme at West Spring provides all students with an all-rounded worldview of Music through the learning of:

*   Elementary Rudiments of Music Theory (note-reading, note values etc.)
*   Ukulele
*   Keyboard
*   Music and Its Role in Society (instruments of various ethnic groups, instruments used at cultural events etc.)
