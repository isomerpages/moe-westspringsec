<p>In the Secondary 1 Music programme, students embark on their musical journey
by learning basic keyboard skills and foundational music theory. They also
take pride in learning to sing the school song, fostering a sense of community
and school spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As students progress to Secondary 2, they delve into the rich world of
ethnic percussion instruments. Through hands-on practice, they explore
diverse rhythms and techniques, gaining a deeper appreciation for cultural
diversity in music. Secondary 2 students also explored iPad Cajon and digital
music integration through workshops where they developed essential audio
production and performance skills, enhancing their creativity and technical
abilities. By the end of the workshop, they are equipped to confidently
perform and showcase their newfound talents and collaborative efforts.
These experiences lay a strong foundation for future musical endeavours,
encouraging students to confidently explore and create.</p>
