The Art Curriculum in West Spring aims to holistically nurture awareness, appreciation and passion for expression in the visual art through artistic knowledge and art-making process. 

Aligned to the MOE Syllabus and infusion of 21st century competencies, our art lessons are designed to develop positive learning dispositions that help all students to become lifelong thinkers and passionate learners. With a student-centred art education in West Spring, our Inquiry-based Art learning journey provides all students the fundamentals of Elements of Art and Principles of Design that facilitate inquiry about visible thinking strategies, big ideas, and authentic learning in the contexts of life-centred issues. Students are actively engaged in Authentic art learning experiences  that allows them to construct their understanding of the natural and human-designed worlds, implement initiatives to develop critical, creative and interdisciplinary thinking skills that would enable students to continue to quest for knowledge throughout life. 

The West Spring Art Department has showcased a Poster Presentation for MOE Excel Fest 2023 (TCEF) titled: An Artistic Journey into a Creative World of Perspective and Illusion of Space.
