The Art Curriculum in West Spring aims to holistically nurture awareness, appreciation and passion for expression in the visual art through artistic knowledge and art-making process. Aligned to the MOE Syllabus and infusion of 21st century competencies, our art lessons are designed to develop positive learning dispositions that help all students to become lifelong thinkers and passionate learners. The Art Department has had an enriching and eventful year, providing students with a multitude of opportunities to explore, create, and showcase their artistic talents.

  

**Exploring the World of Art at the National Gallery Singapore**

A highlight of the year was a visit to the National Gallery Singapore, where students delved into the world of art history and contemporary artists. This immersive experience not only broadened their understanding of different art forms but also inspired them to reflect on their own creative journeys.

**En Plein Air Painting at Emerald Hill**

In another exciting activity, our students ventured to Emerald Hill for an en plein air outdoor watercolour painting session. Under the expert guidance of a renowned local artist, they captured the charm of Singapore's heritage district through their brushes, learning to observe and translate the nuances of light, colour, and atmosphere onto paper. This hands-on experience was a valuable exercise in both technical skill and artistic expression.

**Celebrating Student Achievements at the Singapore Youth Festival 2024**

Our studentsâ€™ hard work and dedication have also been recognized on a larger stage. We are proud to announce that lower and upper secondary students have their artworks featured in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Online Art Gallery 2024, a prestigious platform celebrating young artistic talent. Notably, Kyan Chai Chen Yang from Sec 5A (2023) has had his artwork selected for exhibition at the National Gallery Singapore, a testament to his creativity and skill.

**Developing Critical Skills Through Creative Visual Storytelling**

In addition, our Secondary 3 students participated in a Creative Visual Storytelling workshop with local graphic novel artist Mr. Sean Lam. This workshop was instrumental in developing their critical thinking, digital painting, and narrative creation skills, to prepare them for the digital world and equip them with essential 21st-century skills. These abilities are not only crucial for their current art projects but also for their future endeavours in a rapidly evolving creative landscape. This foundation empowers them to express their ideas effectively and engage audiences, ensuring their artistic growth and success as they navigate their creative journeys in the digital age.
