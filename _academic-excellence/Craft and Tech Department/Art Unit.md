| Key Programmes   | Our Art lessons focus on the Inquiry Art Model (Inquiry based Learning) to develop positive learning dispositions that help our art students become lifelong learners. Each lesson is planned to create exposure and learning opportunities to allow our student-learners to consider the way they perceive and make sense of the world in which they live. Our Inquiry-based Art Learning Journey at West Spring provides all student-artists the fundamentals of Elements of Art and Principles of Design from Lower Secondary through an inquiry learning experience with these themes - (i) Exploration and Experimentation of varied materials and media, (ii) Exploration, Research and Conceptualisation of themes and (iii) Exploration and Development of Self-Expression |
