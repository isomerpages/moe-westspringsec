**Inquiry Based Learning and Activity Based Learning**

The learning experiences in Food and Consumer Education (FCE) and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) encourage students to consider sound principles and values when making food and consumer decisions.

Lower Secondary FCE students undertake projects through which they are required to do research, decision-making, planning and sensory evaluation. Through these, they apply concepts of nutrition and make informed choices as consumers. Students modified a base recipe and created their very own savoury muffins suitable for a fundraising event. In addition, they created advertisements to promote their muffins. Secondary 2 FCE students were introduced to Food Science Investigation where students carried out food experiments and evaluated the outcomes of batters made using different types of flour. They applied their knowledge of scientific principles during food preparation and  the cooking of batters.

Secondary 2 FCE students learned to appreciate the diversity of food from different cultures in Singapore and around the world.  Students presented their research through Show and Tell. 
    
Upper Secondary NFS students were presented with authentic learning experiences where they related and applied real life experiences through given scenarios. This helped students to understand the concept of nutrients and meal planning for various age groups. Students also embarked on the studies of Food Science to be better equipped with knowledge and skills to interpret results pertaining to sensory outcomes of food products they developed.
