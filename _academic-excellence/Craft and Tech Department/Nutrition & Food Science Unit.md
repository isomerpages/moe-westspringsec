<p><strong>Activity-Based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Lower Secondary FCE students completed projects where they had to apply</p>
<p>concepts of nutrition and make informed choices as consumers. Students
created their own creative muffins and conducted various food science investigations.
Along with creating recipes, students also took part in a competition to
create posters about food safety.</p>
<p>Upper Secondary&nbsp;NFS students conducted a food science investigation
on the effects of different types of dairy products on the sensory properties
(appearance, texture, and taste) of ice cream.</p>
<p>Students were encouraged to utilise commonly left-over food at home in
the creation of new dishes. This was part of the NFS unitâ€™s effort to educate
students on the importance of reducing food waste and encouraging food
sustainability.</p>
