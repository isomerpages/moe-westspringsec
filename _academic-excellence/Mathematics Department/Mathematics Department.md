| Key Programmes 	| **Use of Questioning Techniques** 	|
|  	| The Math/POA department pedagogy is Questioning Techniques. Questioning has a crucial role in the process of learning as it stimulates and maintains interest and encourages our students to think and focus on the content. Through planned questioning, we can steer our students’ thinking along a particular route to stimulate learning, to aid recall, and to challenge. 	|
|  	| **Technology in Mathematics**|
||In 2022, the Math department has incorporated our Algebra workshop for selected Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic) in our weekly Learning Support Programme. Similarly, the department also conducted an in-house Geogebra and Excel workshop for all our Secondary 2 Express and Normal (Academic) OOS students in their Math lessons to introduce the software to the students and to equip them with the basic skills for further exploration and for self-directed learning in the area of graphs. This is in sync with the introduction of the PLD initiative in school since last year.	|
