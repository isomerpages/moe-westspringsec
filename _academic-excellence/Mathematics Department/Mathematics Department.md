**Questioning Technique**

The Mathematics department’s pedagogical focus is the use of Questioning Techniques. Questioning has a crucial role in the process of learning as it stimulates and maintains interest and encourages our students to think and focus on the content. Through planned questioning, we steer our students’ thinking along a particular route to stimulate learning, to aid recall, and to challenge.

In May 2023, our students took part in the 2023 Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO) Junior and Senior category, and we are proud to announce that we achieved 1 Bronze Award and 3 Honourable Mentions in the Junior Category and 1 Silver Award and 1 Honourable Mention in the Senior Category!
