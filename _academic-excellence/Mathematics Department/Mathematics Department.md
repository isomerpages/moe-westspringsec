<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, the Mathematics department continued its emphasis on developing
critical thinking through innovative questioning techniques and targeted
training. We focused on preparing selected Secondary 1 and 2 students for
the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad, where customised resources and training
sessions were provided. We are proud that three of our students - Wong
Zi Xian (2A), Ma Weizheng (2D), and Gwee Song Yan (1A) - earned Honourable
Mentions in the Junior Category.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Learning Team Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>Our commitment to enhancing pedagogical practices was demonstrated through
three Professional Learning Team (PLT) projects. The “<em>Computational Thinking</em>”
project guided students in breaking down complex math problems into manageable
steps, using binary responses to create flowcharts that can be translated
into Python code. Our “<em>What Type of Average?</em>” project leveraged
Google Sheets and Variation Theory to explore averages, helping teachers
assess student understanding through formative assessments. Lastly, “<em>Desmos Dynamics</em>”
focused on harnessing Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) to integrate Desmos
into lessons, making learning interactive and personalised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, the Mathematics Department continues to foster
a dynamic and engaging learning environment for our students.</p>
