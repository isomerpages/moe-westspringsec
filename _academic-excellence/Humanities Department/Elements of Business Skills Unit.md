<p>Our students are introduced to business through an understanding of business
activities, focusing on basic marketing and customer relations, in the
context of Singapore. They are also provided with opportunities to develop
transferable employability skills and knowledge in the service industry,
namely the Travel and Tourism, Hospitality, and Retail industries, which
continue to offer employment opportunities. It provides our students with
the foundational knowledge and skills for further studies in institutes
of higher learning and the awareness of prospects of a career in the service
industry. Students are also taught research skills and they will learn
how to curate information online.</p>

<p><u>Work Experience Programme</u>

<p>Our EBS students participated in the Work Experience Program organised
by Mandarin Oriental Hotel during two major events: the Singapore Grand
Prix 2024 F1 Race from 18 to 22 September 2024 and the Morgan Stanley 17th
Annual Asia Pacific Summit from 18 to 21 Nov 2024. The students were attached
to hotel departments such as Food &amp; Beverage and Banquet Operations.
The authentic learning experience included training from industry experts
and it has certainly made EBS content come to life!</p>
