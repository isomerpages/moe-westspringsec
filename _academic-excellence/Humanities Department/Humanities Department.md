<p><strong><u>Historical Investigation (HI)</u> </strong>
</p>
<p>Our lower secondary students had opportunities to appreciate the real-world
application of historical knowledge and skills while helping them to acquire
21CC via HI. One of the highlights for the Secondary two students was to
be purposefully immersed in the rich narratives presented in the National
Museum of Singapore, exploring stories of people in Singapore across generations
and learning to appreciate the connections between the experiences of past
communities and their own lived experiences. Secondary one students explored
the Chinatown Historic District as they discovered the multi-ethnic nature
of this place. They also learnt more about the clans that are still around
in Singapore as they had the opportunity to visit the Phoon Yue Clan Association
as part of this learning journey.</p>
<p><strong><u>Geographical Investigation (GI)</u> </strong>
</p>
<p>The GI fieldwork experience spurred our lower secondary students to go
beyond the classroom to actively look for and gather data to address questions
that are close to their hearts. Students enjoyed the hands-on outdoor learning
at Pang Sua Pond, where they applied fieldwork skills. The integration
of a Science component in this learning experience made it even more meaningful
for students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Model United Nations Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The annual Model United Nations workshop aimed to equip and stretch Sec
3 students with knowledge and skills in order to understand and address
the intricacies and complexities of the world of current affairs and international
relations. Our students honed their skills in critical thinking and brainstorming
as they presented their proposed solutions to real-world problems. In the
3-day workshop, students would gain meaningful experiences as they debated
against each other for the position of the best speaker.</p>
