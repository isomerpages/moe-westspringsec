**Mother Tongue Language Fortnight (MTLF)**

To encourage students to speak their mother languages and understand their own culture, the Chinese and Malay Languages units prepared a two- week programme for all students.

**Cultural Performance Exposure Fund (CPEF)**

The Cultural Performance Exposure Fund (CPEF) is a programme by the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) to allow students to be exposed to and experience local Malay cultural performances to enrich their learning beyond the classroom. This year, Secondary 4 Malay Language students had the opportunity to meet a recipient of the Cultural Medallion award, Mdm. Som Said, at her dance studio Sri Warisan, to learn more about the art of Malay Dance. Secondary 3 students had the chance to learn more about the ‘Orang Laut’ via an immersive theatre titled ‘Air Da Tohor’ for Esplanade’s 2023 Pesta Raya.

**Malay Language and Cultural Immersion Programme**

The annual Language and Cultural Immersion Programme organised by the ML Unit not only aims to instil the love for the Malay culture and tradition through interesting activities, but also provides a platform for the Secondary 1 students and teachers to build positive rapport as they get to know each other. This year, students visited the last surviving kampong in Singapore, Kampong Lorong Buangkok, and participated in activities such as basket weaving and roti kirai making while exploring the sights and sounds of nature.
