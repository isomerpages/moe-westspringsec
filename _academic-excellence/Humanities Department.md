**Highlights of inquiry-based learning in Humanities** 


Historical Investigation (HI)

Our lower secondary students had opportunities to appreciate real-world application of historical knowledge and skills, while helping them to acquire 21CC via HI. One of the highlights for students was to be purposefully immersed in the rich narratives presented in the National Museum of Singapore, exploring stories of people in Singapore across generations and learning to appreciate the connections between the experiences of past communities and their own lived experiences.      

Geographical Investigation (GI)

The GI fieldwork experience spurred our lower secondary students to go beyond the classroom to actively look for and gather data to address questions that are close to their hearts. Students enjoyed the hands-on outdoor learning at Pang Sua Pond where they applied fieldwork skills. The integration of a Science component in this learning experience made it even more meaningful for students.     
  
**Competitions and enrichment**

Through participation in enrichment and competitions, students were given opportunities to experience the joy of learning. The higher readiness students are also stretched to optimise their learning.
