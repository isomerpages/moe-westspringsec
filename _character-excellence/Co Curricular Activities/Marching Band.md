<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The West Spring Marching Band had a remarkable year in 2024, highlighted
by their participation in the SYF Arts Presentation (Marching Band) and
their outstanding achievement of earning a Certificate of Distinction.
Their graduation showcase at the Singapore Indoor Stadium was a momentous
occasion, drawing a crowd of over 500 West Spring supporters, including
students, teachers, alumni, parents, and former principals.</p>
<p>This showcase marked a significant transition for the band as they prepared
to shift from a large display showband to a concert marching band. While
they will embrace a new era of concert music, they will not forget their
cherished marching traditions.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the band is already gearing up to make their mark again
at the Padang for NDP 2025. Stay tuned for their exciting return to the
marching band stage!</p>
