##### Key Programmes 2022

Our members have weekly training sessions, including sectionals. We also have an annual whole-band gathering.

##### Highlights for 2022

**Singapore Youth Festival 2022**

2022 was the year that the West Spring Marching Band participated in a marching band show with the smallest number of performers. Due to Covid restrictions, we were only able to send 50 performers, compared to the usual 90. Nonetheless, the band was still able to sustain a winning streak of Certificate of Distinction in the SYF Arts Presentation of Marching Bands.

**NDP Observance Ceremony**

Celebrating NDP@Heartlands, the band, together with the school’s uniformed groups, took part in the National Day Parade Observation Ceremony held at the Bukit Panjang Community Centre on 7 August, in celebration of the nation’s 57th birthday.

**Malaysia International Virtual Band Championship**

On top of that, the band has represented Singapore on the international platform in the Malaysia International Virtual Band Championships (MIVBC) 2022, a music competition featuring concert band, solo performers, colour guards and marching show bands from around the World. 

This event is sanctioned by the World Association of Marching Show Bands (WAMSB), based in the United States. For their first venture in an international competition, the team clinched the 1st runner-up position for the senior division (aged 16-19) in the marching show band category. It is indeed an honour and privilege to be recognised in the international marching band scene!
