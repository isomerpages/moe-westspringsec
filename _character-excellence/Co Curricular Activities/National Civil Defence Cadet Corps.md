**Key Programmes**

National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group under the purview of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Singapore Civil Defence Force. West Spring NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our cadets to be equipped with life saving skills to respond effectively to emergencies. In 2023, in addition to equipping our cadets with essential life-saving skills, NCDCC cadets were involved in key programmes to showcase their resilience and tenacity in honing their footdrill skills. Cadets also had the opportunity to reach out and serve the Bukit Panjang residents through a VIA programme organised by West Spring National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) to raise awareness on water conservation efforts.
