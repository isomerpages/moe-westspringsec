<p>Our football programme offers weekly training sessions focused on skill
development and team cohesion, along with active participation in the CCA
Open House to engage and inspire new members. Additionally, friendly matches
with other schools provide valuable competitive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key highlight of the programme is our students’ participation in the
National Schools Games (NSG). As a result of the boys’ hard work and dedication,
the ‘B’ Division Boys capped off the year with an impressive 4th-place
finish in League 1.</p>
