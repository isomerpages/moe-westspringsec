##### **Key Programmes 2022**

Our footballers took part in 2 - 3 training sessions a week under the guidance of their coach.  We also had specially curated fitness programmes in partnership with commercial gym Grityard, where our footballers were regularly exposed to a variety of fitness drills to train their speed, agility and endurance.

This year, our footballers represented the school at the ‘B’ Division and ‘C’ Division National School Games competitions. 

We also had CCA team bonding sessions to build friendships of a lifetime.
