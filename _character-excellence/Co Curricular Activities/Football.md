**CCA Key Programmes**

Character Development

Other than equipping members with the necessary skills as a member of the Football CCA, there is also a huge emphasis on character building and moral values. One highlight that took place during the September holidays was our Football CCA Day Camp whereby our footballers were brought through the Goals for Success & Growth Mindset Workshop branded by veteran footballer Fandi Ahmad himself.

  
Team Building

Our Football CCA members also look forward to bonding sessions where they can have some fun aside from training. These sessions typically take place once per semester.
