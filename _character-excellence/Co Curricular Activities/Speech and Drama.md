<p>The Speech and Drama Club is a dynamic platform where students cultivate
a wide range of essential skills for theatrical performances. Key highlights
include student-led productions that showcase both on-stage talent and
behind-the-scenes expertise in sound production, props, and costume design.
Members gain invaluable public speaking experience by emceeing major events
such as the SEA Ceremony and the school open house, where they also present
vibrant stage productions for various celebrations like Chinese New Year.
Internal competitions in improvisation further encourage skill development,
providing a supportive environment for students to shine. These experiences
not only build confidence and performance skills but also foster a strong
sense of community and collaboration, deepening studentsâ€™ appreciation
for the performing arts.</p>
