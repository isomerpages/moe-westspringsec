Students learn a variety of skills throughout the year. Some of these skills include voice projection, prop making, scriptwriting and storytelling using podcasts. 

Students also took part in the Singapore Youth Festival competition and had obtained the Certificate of Accomplishment. They had taken up distinct roles in the competition such as actors, costume designers, stage managers, backstage crew and prop makers.  

At the school level, students had performed in school events such as Chinese New Year and Teachers’ Day, where students worked with one another closely to create a lively and engaging performance. 
  
To better appreciate the development of the arts scene in Singapore, students had also attended a performance, ‘Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs’.
