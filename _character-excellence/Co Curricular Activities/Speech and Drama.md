##### **Key Programmes 2022**

Students learn a variety of skills throughout the year. Some of these skills include stage combat, delivery of monologues, musical theatre and fictional story telling using podcasts.

Students represented the school in two competitions this year. For the ‘International Science Drama’ competition, students produced their original scripts and took on distinct roles such as cast, sound director, video editor and props creators. Students also took part in ‘SYFgoesOnline!’ where they wrote and delivered their monologues in an engaging manner based on the given theme. 

At the school level, emcees for the School Excellence Awards Ceremony, National Day Parade and Valediction Ceremony were selected from the CCA. We have also performed during Racial Harmony Day and Teachers’ Day Celebration. 

To better appreciate the development of the arts scene in Singapore, students also attended a backstage tour of the Esplanade.
