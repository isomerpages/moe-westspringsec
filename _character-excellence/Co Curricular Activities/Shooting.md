**Mental Skills Training for Shooters (In-Person & via Zoom)**

This programme is specially designed to train the mental strength and resilience of shooters, for both ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions, in preparation for competitions. Mental Skills Training includes strengthening and conditioning of the mind towards shooters’ goals and competitive spirit. 

  

**Intra & Inter school games and competitions**

The club’s focus is the National School Games. We also participate in other competitions hosted by the Singapore Shooting Association, NUS & NTU Invitational Shoots. We also conduct intra-shooting competitions to encourage shooters to compete with one another to hone their shooting skills, even when it is not the competition season. 

  

**Physical Training Activity**

Physical Training (PT) is essential for shooters to be fitter and have the strength to persevere through long sessions of shoots and increase competition stamina.
