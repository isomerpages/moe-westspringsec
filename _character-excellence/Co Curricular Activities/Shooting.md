<p><strong>National School Games<br></strong>Our student-athletes compete
in the 'B' and 'C' Divisions for both pistol and rifle shooting at the
National School Games (NSG). They train 4 to 5 times a week, focusing on
resilience, sportsmanship, and personal bests. Preparation for NSG involves
both physical training and reflection to ensure continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Intra and Inter-School Competitions<br></strong>Beyond NSG, our
shooters participate in various annual competitions such as the NUS and
NIS shoots, the Singapore Cup, and friendly matches with the Sports School.
These events boost their morale and help them hone their skills throughout
the year, even during the off-season.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Training and Reflection<br></strong>Physical Training
(PT) is essential for building the endurance needed for long shooting sessions.
Reflection sessions allow shooters to track progress, share feedback with
peers and coaches, and continuously improve both their performance and
mindset.</p>
