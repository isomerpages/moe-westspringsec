##### **Key Programmes 2022**

Our teams have weekly training sessions throughout the year. This year, we participated in the National School Games for ‘B’ Division in Term 2 and ‘C’ Division in Term 3 in 2022. We also have Team Bonding Day at the end of the year, as well as a farewell ceremony for the Sec 4 and 5 seniors. Our teams also participate in WSSS Badminton Friendly Competition with other schools, which provide opportunities for students to participate in external competitions.
