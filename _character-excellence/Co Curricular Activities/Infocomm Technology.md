<p>The Infocom Media Club had a dynamic year, capturing major school events
and celebrations while participating in various competitions. The club
played a crucial role in documenting these moments, with highlights including
live feeds for the schoolâ€™s National Day Parade and providing AVA support
for celebrations.</p>
<p>Members also get to hone their skills through various workshops, such
as Gelatin Printmaking, Videography, New Media Programme that uses Apple
Technologies, Game Development with Game Maker, Python and Roblox programming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club proudly participated in the SDMA Digital Awards, competing in
both Video and Comic Strip categories. Additionally, our Sec 3 students
