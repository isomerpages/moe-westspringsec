The Volleyball team had participated in an external competition organised by JRT academy in June. 

Our Secondary 2 Boys had emerged as the 1st Runner up in the competition.

The team had also organised friendly matches with other schools from the various zones and represented our school in both the ‘B’ division and ‘C’ Division West Zone competitions.
