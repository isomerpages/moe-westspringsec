<p>The Netball team actively participates in various external carnivals and
competitions, including the prestigious Daisy Tan Carnival, as well as
the annual National School Games. This year, our talented B Division team
emerged as champions at the Daisy Tan Carnival 2024, showcasing their skills
and determination. The C Division team also had an impressive run, reaching
the quarter-finals in League 3 of the National School Games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these achievements, the team organised friendly matches
with schools like Jurong West Secondary School, fostering sportsmanship
and team spirit. These experiences not only enhance the players' skills
but also build lasting camaraderie.</p>
