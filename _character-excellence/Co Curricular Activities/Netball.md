Netball ladies take part in external carnivals and competitions such as Deloitte Pesta Sukan apart from the annual Inter-School Netball Championships. 

The netball team has also organised friendly matches with other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School. 

A number of our ladies were selected to be in the Under-17 and Under-14 National School Development Squad, where they had the opportunities to train and play with players from other schools in the West Zone.
