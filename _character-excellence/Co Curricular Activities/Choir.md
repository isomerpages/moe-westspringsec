<p>Established in 2026, the West Spring Secondary School Choir aspires to
contribute actively to the school's musical culture through performances
at school events, community festivals, inter-school choral exchanges, and
public concerts. The choir nurtures students who possess passion and commitment
to singing and performing, empowering them to use their voices to connect
with and serve their community.</p>
<p>In an effort to develop valuable skills beyond singing, the choir adopts
a holistic approach to CCA sessions. Student-led activities that encourage
meaningful dialogue and cultivate leadership capabilities form an integral
part of the choir experience, fostering personal growth alongside musical
excellence.</p>
