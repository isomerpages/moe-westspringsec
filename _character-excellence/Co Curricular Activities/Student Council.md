<p>The Student Council at West Spring Secondary School operates under the
TLC leadership model—Take Charge, Lead by Example, and Communicate Effectively—adapted
from Kouzes and Posner's "The Leadership Challenge." This structure empowers
students to step up, set positive examples, and maintain clear communication
within the council and the wider school community.</p>
<p>Council members give back to the school by organising events such as the
EAS Appreciation Lunch to honour non-teaching staff and Teacher’s Day celebrations.
They also play a crucial role in the Sec 1 Orientation, ensuring new students
feel welcomed and integrated into school life.</p>
<p>Additionally, the council embarks on impactful projects like planning
the Student Leadership Academy, a three-day training programme that inducts
top student leaders into the school’s leadership body. Through these initiatives,
the Student Council exemplifies the core values of service, teamwork, and
leadership, contributing significantly to the vibrant school culture at
West Spring.</p>
