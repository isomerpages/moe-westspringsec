##### Key Programmes 2022

Led by one of the heads of the Student Council for each programme, the Student Councillors planned and organised the following four key school programmes yearly: Student Leaders’ Investiture, National Day Celebration, Teachers’ Day Celebration and Sec 1 Orientation 

##### Highlights for 2022
There were two key events that involved the student councillors. In June, they had a 3-day Student Councillor Camp which culminated in a campfire. In November, the Sec 2 students together with potential Sec 2 CCA student leaders went through a 3-day Student Leaders Academy where they were assessed on their ability to lead their peers and others. 

Besides that, the student councillors formed several School Improvement Teams (SITs) whereby they became the voice of the student population and spoke up for changes to improve the overall school experience.

The student councillors also rallied the school population in an umbrella donation drive as part of the Share-An-Umbrella initiative in which the school partnered with Zhenghua Grassroots Group to provide umbrellas for residents and students to use during inclement weather.
