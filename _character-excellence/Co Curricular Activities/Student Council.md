This year, the student councillors had organised and ran a 4-day Secondary 1 Orientation programme at the start of the year. It was the first time that they ran the entire programme on their own.

SpringFest also made its return this year. In conjunction with Teachersâ€™ Day, the student councillors had planned a fun and meaningful carnival for everyone, from staff to students and even alumni, to participate.

The student councillors also had a camp during the June holidays. It was the first time since the pandemic that they were able to experience a residential camp. It was an opportunity for the current batch of secondary two and three student councillors to get to know one another better and work together as one student council.
