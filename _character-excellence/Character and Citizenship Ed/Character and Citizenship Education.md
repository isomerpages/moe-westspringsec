West Spring Secondary School CCE Programmes strives to provide a strong student character and leadership development focus. The design of the school’s CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame and is anchored on the school’s vision, mission and values.

CCE’s Curriculum Content is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.

**CCE Lessons**

CCE Lessons are customised and our school values are incorporated into the lesson objectives. This includes content areas of National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW) and Family Education (FE), in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful for our students.

**Contemporary Issues**

The discussion of contemporary issues in the CCE lessons will be a regular feature. Current and relevant topics will be discussed in a sensitive and open manner, in a safe environment where our students learn to appreciate multiple points of views, exercise critical thinking and respect for each other, even when perspectives differ.

**School-Based Lessons**

School-based lessons with relevant scenarios are designed to focus on school values. We strive to develop our students to have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of right and wrong, taking responsibility for choices and actions, showing care towards others and being resilient when faced with challenges.

**Recognition of Good Character**

In recognition of exemplary character, the Edusave Character Awards are given to Secondary Four students who are Singapore Citizens and have consistently exhibited exemplary character, demonstrating the values of Responsibility, Resilience, Respect, Integrity and Care through their behaviour and actions.
