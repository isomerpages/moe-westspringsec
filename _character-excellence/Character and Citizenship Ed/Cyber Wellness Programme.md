With Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) becoming increasingly pervasive in our world, our students need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT. This is the aim of Cyber Wellness, which is part of Curriculum & Character Education (CCE).

There are 3 Cyber Wellness key messages that we hope to impart to our students:

1. Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities.

2. Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.

3. Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace.

**Objectives of West Spring’s Cyber Wellness programme**

– To prepare our West Spring ladies and gentlemen to be future-ready and responsible digital learners by advocating good Cyber Wellness habits through Assembly programs, Cyber Wellness workshops and school-wide activities

– To empower and equip our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) to be advocates of proper use of technology by providing them with necessary knowledge and skills to carry out school-wide activities
