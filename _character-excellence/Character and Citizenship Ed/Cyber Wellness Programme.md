With Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) becoming increasingly pervasive in our world, our students need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT. This is the aim of Cyber Wellness, which is part of Curriculum & Character Education (CCE).

There are 3 Cyber Wellness key messages that we hope to impart to our students:

1. Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities.

2. Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.

3. Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace.

**Objectives of West Spring’s Cyber Wellness programme**

– To prepare our West Spring ladies and gentlemen to be future-ready and responsible digital learners by advocating good Cyber Wellness habits through Assembly programs, Cyber Wellness workshops and school-wide activities

– To empower and equip our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) to be advocates of proper use of technology by providing them with necessary knowledge and skills to carry out school-wide activities

In January 2022, the Secondary One students attended a Cyber Wellness workshop, conducted by TOUCH Cyber Wellness. At this workshop, through games and case studies, our students learnt more about engaging the digital space, Internet and gaming addiction.

During the March holiday, the Secondary Two and Three PSLs came together, over two days, to prepare for a Cyber Wellness CCE lesson, which they would facilitate in their respective classes during Cyber Wellness Week in Term 2. Using resources that were given to them, our PSLs brainstormed for activities and games that they could carry out in class so as to provide an enriching Cyber Wellness lesson for their classmates. ICT tools such as Mentimeter and Kahoot were used to engage the students. Working together to facilitate a CCE lesson helped to improve the confidence of our PSLs and contribute to their leadership training.
