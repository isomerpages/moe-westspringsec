<h4>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support
students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes
as they grow up and develop safe and healthyudents to make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and
respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality
Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more

<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity
and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle
adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period
for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities
(including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant
consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer
acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act
responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from
within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense
of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>At West Spring Secondary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2025</u>:</strong>

<p><strong>What is sexuality education?</strong>
</p>
<p>Sexuality education is a process of gaining knowledge and forming attitudes,
beliefs and values regarding human sexuality.</p>
<p>MOE sexuality education covers the following areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Physical</strong>: Sexual maturity and intimacy, physiology of
sex and human reproduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emotional</strong>: Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self
and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social</strong>: Sexual norms and behaviour, and the legal, cultural
and societal implications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethical</strong>: Values and moral systems related to sexuality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Why have sexuality education?</strong></h4>
<p>Our children are growing up with a wide range of influences through the
internet. Sexuality education aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop healthy relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others
by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that
are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is sexuality education delivered?</strong>
</p>
<p>Sexuality education is a combined effort which begins at home with parents,
continues in schools with teachers, and is supplemented by community efforts.</p>
<p>The 6 guiding principles of sexuality education are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Parents play the primary role in educating their children and are responsible
for teaching and transmitting values on sex and sexuality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our educators will impart knowledge, skills and values that reflect that
of Singapore’s mainstream society so that students will make informed and
responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aligned with our national values of encouraging heterosexual married couples
to have healthy relationships with each other, and to build stable nuclear
family units with extended family support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only specially selected and trained teachers will teach Sexuality Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students and teachers are to respect the different attitudes, values and
beliefs that different communities may have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant community resources that are aligned and approved by MOE may
be used to supplement schools’ programme.</p>
