Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips our students with the knowledge, skills and values needed to make informed decisions at key education stages to successfully transit from school to further education or work. 

         
**Goals of ECG**

![Figure 1](/images/Picture1.jpg)

The goals of ECG (Figure 1) are to support students in:

*   **Discovering purpose** - Who am I?  
    Nurture students' self-awareness to support them in discovering how they can meaningfully play a part in their community.
*   **Exploring opportunities** - Where do I want to go?  
    Develop students' self-directedness and confidence to explore and leverage education and career opportunities while respecting the value of all occupations.
*   **Staying relevant** - How do I get there?  
    Build students' adaptability and resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning.

The CCE curriculum is delivered as part of the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) syllabus. Our students will receive at least 4 hours of ECG lessons each year, guided by their Form teachers. The SkillsFuture Portal is a one-stop ECG resource portal  with self-discovery tools and information on future pathways for every child.
