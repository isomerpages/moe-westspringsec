Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips our students with the knowledge, skills and values needed to make informed decisions at key education stages to successfully transit from school to further education or work. The ECG curriculum focuses on exploration, helping our students understand themselves better and guide their exploration of different education and career pathways. Through the 4 or 5 years, our students learn to be more aware of their skills, interests and abilities, manage relationships with people who have influence over their decisions, explore relevant courses of study and understand careers in different sectors.

The curriculum is delivered as part of the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) syllabus. Our students will receive at least 4 hours of ECG lessons each year, guided by their Form teachers. The SkillsFuture Portal is a one-stop ECG resource portal  with self-discovery tools and information on future pathways for every child.
