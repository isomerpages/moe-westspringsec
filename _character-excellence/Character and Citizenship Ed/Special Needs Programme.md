West Spring is a Special Needs Resource School, providing support for students with mild Special Needs in a mainstream setting.

The school has a team of Allied Educators (AED-Teaching and Learning), a Learning Behavioural Support (AED-LBS) educator and teachers who are trained in Special Needs (TSNs).

TSNs are trained with deeper knowledge and skills to better support students with mild special educational needs in our school. TSNs of West Spring are able to plan instruction, adapt and differentiate the instructional strategies to meet the needs of diverse learners in our school. We also aim to build the capacity of our fellow teachers in our school on the strategies and resources to support students with special 
educational needs.
