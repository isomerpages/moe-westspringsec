West Spring Secondary has established itself as a popular school, attracting many students in the Bukit Panjang, Upper Bukit Timah and Choa Chu Kang areas.  We are grateful for the past efforts of the previous Principals and staff in building a strong foundation.  It is heartening to learn that the school has established a reputation for being a school with good discipline with a strong emphasis on holistic development in the community it is located.

West Spring strives to provide an engaging academic programme and a strong student character and leadership development focus.  We aim to develop our students into Ladies and Gentlemen of Character and Learning.  We hope to provide a caring and conducive environment that will nurture them to be respectful, responsible and resilient individuals who have integrity and are able to care for themselves and others.  Character development is highly emphasised in the school with the belief that it is necessary for our students to be self-disciplined individuals and carry with them the appropriate mindset and attitudes for learning and living.

In allowing them to navigate in a complex technological world, our Applied Learning programme in Media Literacy helps our students to be critical media consumers and competent media producers.  These important competencies will equip them with the required skills that are essential for work, life and citizenship.  Our Learning for Life programme – STAR, hopes to inculcate values of sportsmanship (S), teamwork(T) and(A) resilience(R) through sports and music.  We do not need every student to be a sportsman/sportswoman or a musician in order to be a ‘star’.  All of them can internalise the values and be that ‘star’ in their own lives and in others’ lives.

We recognise that we cannot do all these alone.  We are blessed in West Spring to have wonderful support from our parents, School Advisory Committee and the community.  We are confident that the school will continue to grow in strength to strength as we shape our students’ character, engage them in learning and touch their lives.
