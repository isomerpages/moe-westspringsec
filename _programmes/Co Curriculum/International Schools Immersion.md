At West Spring Secondary School, we believe in the value of overseas learning trips for our students. We believe that overseas learning journeys can broaden our studentsâ€™ outlook and mindset, help them know more about the region and at the same time, deepen their commitment to Singapore. The trips can also enrich their educational experience and their collective memories of secondary school life. The trips are often the highlight for our students, especially for those who may not otherwise have the chance to travel overseas.

There are various opportunities for our students to participate in different types of overseas learning trips. Each trip has different and specific learning objectives, and seeks to provide our students a broad and holistic educational experience beyond the classroom.
