With an increasingly digitalised world, our students need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT. This is the aim of Cyber Wellness, which is part of Curriculum & Character Education (CCE).

There are 3 main principles to guide our students’ decision-making and anchor their well-being:

1\. Respect for self and others.

2\. Safe and responsible use.

3\. Positive peer influence.

**Objectives of West Spring’s Cyber Wellness programmes**

– To prepare our West Spring ladies and gentlemen to be future-ready and responsible digital learners by advocating good Cyber Wellness habits through Assembly programs, Cyber Wellness workshops and Safer Internet Day activities

– To empower and equip our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to be advocates of proper use of technology by providing them with necessary knowledge and skills to carry out school-wide activities

In 2021, because of the pandemic, the school was unable to carry out many school-wide Cyber Wellness events. As such, the Cyber Wellness activities were mostly classroom-based.

In January, the Secondary One students attended a Cyber Wellness workshop, conducted by TOUCH Cyber Wellness. Through this workshop, the students learnt more about the hurtful nature of cyberbullying, as well as the dangers of gaming and Internet addiction. Through activities and case studies, our students were made aware of the current trends of these issues, their harmful effects and given tips to overcome these challenges and help others. At the end of the workshop, the Secondary One students created posters to advocate the prevention of cyberbullying, gaming and Internet addiction.

During the March holiday, the Secondary Two and Three Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) came together, over two days, to prepare for a Cyber Wellness CCE lesson, which they would facilitate in their respective classes during Cyber Wellness Week in Term 2. Using resources that were given to them, our PSLs brainstormed for activities and games that they could carry out in class so as to provide an enriching Cyber Wellness lesson for their classmates. ICT tools such as Mentimeter and Kahoot were used to engage the students. Working together to facilitate a CCE lesson helped to improve the confidence of our PSLs and contribute to their leadership training.
