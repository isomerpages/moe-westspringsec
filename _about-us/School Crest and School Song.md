### **School Crest**

<img style="width:40%;height:50%" src="/images/Homepage/WEST-SPRING-SEC-transparent-bg.png">

‘W’ represents a waterfall of a never ending flow of knowledge from the book.   
It is also a fountain that sends knowledge from the students up to the book.  
It is never ending thirst for knowledge.  
The three ‘S’ are in red and symbolise flames of passion for learning, perseverance and excellence.

### **School Song**                                                                             
There’s a spring that’s a bubbling  
in our corner of the earth  
Come drink our waters and be quenched  
Come taste of the wisdom, come be of the wise  
Our fountain of knowledge, our fountain of life
                                       
**Chorus**

Here, We will be winners  
Here, We will achieve  
Here, With soul and spirit

‘Cause here,  
At West Spring we believe

At West Spring a new day is dawning  
A new age calling us to be  
Come taste of the wisdom, come be of the wise  
Our fountain of knowledge, our fountain of life  
 
 **Chorus**

Here, at West Spring  we believe  
Here, at West Spring  we believe
