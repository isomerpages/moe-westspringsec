<h2>Direct Schools Admission (Background)</h2>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE’s move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students
for admission outside of the centralized posting system, via their own
selection criteria. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools
wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind
the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes
available to develop the area of talent.</p>
<h2>DSA-Sec@WSSS (West Spring Secondary School)</h2>
<p>West Spring Secondary School (WSSS) welcomes prospective students who
demonstrate talent, passion and ability in our identified Sports talent
categories. They are<strong> Badminton, Football and Shooting</strong>.
Successful applicants will join WSSS in January 2025. <strong>Students who are keen to apply should possess a strong level of motivation and commitment to the talent area</strong>.
While achievement level and mastery in their chosen area is key, we are
also scouting for students who display strong potential in their areas
of choice. Our DSA talents should also have the mind-set and learning disposition
to cope well with other aspects of school life in WSSS.</p>
<p>Students admitted into WSSS via DSA will have the opportunity to be trained
and guided by professional coaches and experienced CCA Teachers in-charge.
Nurturing everyone’s talent area, the school seeks to provide every DSA
student with quality programmes, activities and opportunities to represent
the school in competitions. Besides development in their talent area, we
will monitor and motivate students to excel in their academic performance.</p>
