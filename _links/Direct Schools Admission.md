The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE’s move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralized posting system, via their own selection criteria. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

From 2023, application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be opened from May to June 2023. For more details, please refer to MOE website – www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/direct-admissions/dsa-sec.

West Spring Secondary School is proud to announce that with the implementation of its Learning for Life Programme (LLP)- **STAR**, aims to build values of sportsmanship, teamwork and resilience. Up to 20% of the Secondary One vacancies may be offered for DSA places for Shooting, Badminton and Football, if they qualify.

In line with the school's belief to provide a balanced and holistic education, the Co-Curricular Programmes have been designed to allow our students to experience an enriching learning journey over the four years in school, and to challenge each member to attain greater heights in their chosen interest/talent area in performing arts, media and sports.
