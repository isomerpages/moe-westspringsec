<h2>Direct Schools Admission (Background)</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004
as part of MOE’s move towards a more flexible and broad-based education
system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage
of their students for admission outside of the centralized posting system,
via their own selection criteria. Parents and students are encouraged to
choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing
in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes
available to develop the area of talent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 2025, application for DSA-Sec can be submitted
through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and
will be opened from May to June 2025. For more details, please refer to
MOE website – <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa</a>.
